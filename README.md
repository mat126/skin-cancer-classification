# 🧠 Skin Cancer Classification

This project focuses on the classification of skin lesions using deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It aims to combine image data with structured metadata to improve melanoma detection.

## 📦 Project Status
🚧 Work in progress – Model architecture is under development (CNN + metadata fusion).

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset comes from [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge]).  
Due to size limitations, raw images are not included in this repository. You can download them following the instructions in `[data/README.md](data/README.md)`.

## 📌 Goals
- Perform EDA and preprocessing of dermatoscopic images and clinical metadata
- Train and evaluate CNN models
- Compare image-only models with hybrid models using metadata

## 📊 Tools
- Python (Keras, TensorFlow, Pandas, OpenCV)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
